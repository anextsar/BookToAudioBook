# BookToAudioBook
This project aims to build an intelligent, end-to-end pipeline that converts a PDF document into a professionally narrated, chapter-wise audiobook. The pipeline leverages AI technologies—specifically OpenAI’s ChatGPT for intelligent content structuring and narration planning, and Sarvam AI’s text-to-speech (TTS) engine for natural voice synthesis.
